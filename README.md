Project Censored podcasts
=============================

<a href="www.kodi.tv">Kodi</a> audio addon for the <a href="https://projectcensored.org">Project Censored</a> and the <a href="https://www.projectcensored.org/atl/">Along The Line</a> podcasts.<br>

<a href="https://projectcensored.org">Project Censored</a> educates students and the public about the importance of a truly free press for democratic self-government.  We expose and oppose news censorship and we promote independent investigative journalism, media literacy, and critical thinking. Through our website, weekly radio program, annual book, and other programs, we provide this service to the United States, Canada, UK, and the world.<br>

Censorship undermines democracy. An informed public is crucial to democracy in at least two basic ways.  First, without access to relevant news and opinion, people cannot fully participate in government. Second, without media literacy, people cannot evaluate for themselves the quality or significance of the news they receive. Project Censoredâ€™s work highlights the important links among a free press, media literacy, and democratic self-government.<br>
